<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>&lt;li&gt;remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">       </span>&lt;li&gt;transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>&lt;/li&gt;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>&lt;li&gt;This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by WeCognize at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.&lt;/li&gt;</p>
